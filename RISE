I encountered an attack of COVID19 and fell sick for a few days. I was at rock bottom of my life due to the depressive episodes following the sickness. I almost felt the same way 
22nd Feb 2020. I felt connected. I went to my doctor Gojen to treat me. I told him everything what I was feeling and everything that troubled me. He then forgave me and wish me 
best of luck for my future endeavours and I deserve all the happiness in the world. He made me feel loved. Kimpu, Mama, Somen, Birjeet helped me realise that they love me 
no matter what and so I don't need to worry. As Somen said, don't worry, have fun, sleep like a child and don't think about anything.

I went to Sir Sarjuman's place and had a moment with some of my friends. My friends and my parents are my Energy and I am here for them. I feel loved, energised with all the love
and support from my friends. 
So, my friends are my greatest possession :)
